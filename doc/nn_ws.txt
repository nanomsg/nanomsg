nn_ws(7)
========

NAME
----
nn_ws - WebSocket transport mechanism


SYNOPSIS
--------
*#include <nanomsg/nn.h>*

*#include <nanomsg/websocket.h>*


DESCRIPTION
-----------

THIS IS AN EXPERIMENTAL FEATURE. DO NOT USE. THE FUNCTIONALITY IS SUBJECT TO
CHANGE WITHOUT NOTICE.

When connecting to a nanomsg socket that has been bound with `nn_bind()`, the
following header values for `Sec-WebSocket-Protocol` are used during the
opening handshake to determine scalability protocol roles of the two endpoints
in the connection:

* x-nanomsg-pair maps to NN_PAIR
* x-nanomsg-req maps to NN_REQ
* x-nanomsg-rep maps to NN_REP
* x-nanomsg-pub maps to NN_PUB
* x-nanomsg-sub maps to NN_SUB
* x-nanomsg-surveyor maps to NN_SURVEYOR
* x-nanomsg-respondent maps to NN_RESPONDENT
* x-nanomsg-push maps to NN_PUSH
* x-nanomsg-pull maps to NN_PULL
* x-nanomsg-bus maps to NN_BUS

When calling either `nn_bind()` or `nn_connect()`, omitting the port defaults
to the RFC 6455 default port 80 for HTTP. Example:

ws://127.0.0.1 _is equivalent to_ ws://127.0.0.1:80


The Significance of the Pair Scalability Protocol
-------------------------------------------------
When using the NN_PAIR scalability protocol (e.g., during connection initiation,
the opening handshake includes `Sec-WebSocket-Protocol: x-nanomsg-pair`), a
nanomsg connection is able to have bidirectional communication with any
arbitrary WebSocket connection.

For example, a socket of type NN_PAIR may connect to an arbitrary WebSocket
service that is nanomsg-agnostic. Assuming the nanomsg application is able
to intelligibly produce and consume the protocol of the remote service, they
are able to communicate, with the remote service remaining unaware its remote
peer is a nanomsg PAIR socket.

This ability is only enabled with NN_PAIR, and no other scalability protocol,
since other scalability protocols may add additional wire-level framing to
Rx/Tx traffic, or additional semantics or restrictions to send/recv order.
NN_PAIR adds no such additional framing nor semantics on send/recv order, and
for this reason is conducive to interoperability.


Connecting to an Arbitrary WebSocket Service
--------------------------------------------
When calling `nn_connect()`, the URI may also optionally include the path to a
resource and/or query parameters.

  _Example_
  s1 = nn_socket (AF_SP, NN_PAIR);
  nn_connect (s1, "ws://example.com/path?query=value");

This extended URI may help in situations with service protocol requirements, or
routing through existing HTTP infrastructure such as reverse proxies. The URI
is effectively only useful for routing and establishing the connection with
non-nanomsg services. Once established, this additional information is not
available via the nanomsg API.

The spirit of these extended URIs is to enable interoperability with existing
services and infrastructure, and not necessarily to give nanomsg connections a
new means of controlling the opening handshake.

A nanomsg socket accepting connections after calling `nn_bind()` does not use
this additional path or query parameters, except for incidentally satisfying any
intermediate HTTP infrastructure used to route the connection to the nanomsg
socket accepting connections.


Socket Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

TODO: NN_TCP_NODELAY::
    This option, when set to 1, disables Nagle's algorithm. It also disables
    delaying of TCP acknowledgments. Using this option improves latency at
    the expense of throughput. Type of this option is int. Default value is 0.


EXAMPLE
-------

----
nn_bind (s1, "ws://*:5555");
nn_connect (s2, "ws://myserver:5555");
