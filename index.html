<b>WARNING: nanomsg is still in beta stage!</b>

<p><i>nanomsg</i> is a socket library that provides several common communication patterns. It aims to make the networking layer fast, scalable, and easy to use. Implemented in C, it works on a wide range of operating systems with no further dependencies.</p>

<p>The communication patterns, also called "scalability protocols", are basic blocks for building distributed systems. By combining them you can create a vast array of distributed applications. The following scalability protocols are currently available:</p>

<ul>
<li>PAIR - simple one-to-one communication
<li>BUS - simple many-to-many communication
<li>REQREP - allows to build clusters of stateless services to process user requests
<li>PUBSUB - distributes messages to large sets of interested subscribers
<li>PIPELINE - aggregates messages from multiple sources and load balances them among many destinations
<li>SURVEY - allows to query state of multiple applications in a single go
</ul>

<p>Scalability protocols are layered on top of the transport layer in the network stack. At the moment, the <i>nanomsg</i> library supports the following transports mechanisms:</p>

<ul>
<li>INPROC - transport within a process (between threads, modules etc.)
<li>IPC - transport between processes on a single machine
<li>TCP - network transport via TCP
</ul>

<p>The library exposes a BSD-socket-like C API to the applications.</p>

<p>It is licensed under MIT/X11 license.</p>
