nn_symbol(3)
============

NAME
----
nn_symbol - query the names and values of nanomsg symbols


SYNOPSIS
--------
*#include <nanomsg/nn.h>*

*const char *nn_symbol (int 'i', int '*value');*


DESCRIPTION
-----------
Retrieves the symbol name and value at index 'i'.  Indices start at 0.  An index
has no significance to its associated symbol; the mappings may change between
library versions.

Typically a client will iterate through the symbols until nn_symbol returns
NULL in order to collect all the symbols.  


RETURN VALUE
------------
If 'i' is valid, returns the name of the symbol at that index.  If the pointer
'value' is not NULL, the symbol's value is stored there.

If 'i' is out-of-range, nn_symbol returns NULL and sets 'errno' to EINVAL.


ERRORS
------
*EINVAL*::
The passed index 'i' was out-of-range; it was less than zero or greater-than-or-
equal-to the number of symbols.


EXAMPLE
-------

----
int value, i;
for (i = 0; ; ++i) {
    const char* name = nn_symbol (i, &value);
    if (name == NULL) break;
    printf ("'%s' = %d\n", name, value);
}
