Release process
===============

1. Check CI (http://build.nanomsg.org/waterfall).

2. Check AppVeyor https://ci.appveyor.com/project/gdamore/nanomsg

3. Check Travis CI https://travis-ci.org/nanomsg/nanomsg

4. "make distcheck" to check whether the packaging process still works.

5. Bump ABI version as appropriate (see the docs on versioning). This happens
   in src/nn.h, check links there on which numbers to update.

6. Commit and push back to the public repo.

7. Tag the new version, e.g. git tag -a 0.3-beta.  (Make sure to use -a
   to create an annotated tag.)

8. Push the tag to the repo, e.g. git push origin 0.3-beta.

9. Wait a little bit for Travis CI to build, and create artifacts.
   (Travis does this automatically for tagged releases.)

10. Check the github releases page - a release for the tag should have
    already been created with artifacts ready to download.

11. Upload the "download" page on the website (see gh-pages branch of the
    repo).  The only thing that needs to be updated is the LATEST RELEASE
    number and date.

12. Generate the docs (./configure --enable-doc; make).

13. In online docs (gh-pages) make a new folder (e.g. v0.3) and copy the HTML
    docs there.

14. Link the docs from "documentation.html" page.

15. Send the announcement about the release. These commands might be useful:
    git log --oneline 0.2-alpha..0.3-beta | wc -l
    git diff -U0 0.2-alpha..0.3-beta AUTHORS

16. Update the topic in the chatroom accordingly.
