sp_term(3)
==========

NAME
----
sp_term - uninitialise the nanomsg library


SYNOPSIS
--------
*#include <sp/sp.h>*

*int sp_term (void);*


DESCRIPTION
-----------
Uninitialises the nanomsg library. If the library was initialised multiple
times, it is uninitialised only when _sp_term()_ call is executed
for each corresponding linknanomsg:sp_init[3] call.

Calling _sp_term()_ without prior call to linknanomsg:sp_init[3] results in
undefined behaviour.

To help with shutdown of multi-threaded programs nanomsg permits to call
_sp_term()_ while some of the sockets are still open. In such case _sp_term()_
call blocks and waits while all the sockets are closed.

If a thread is blocked inside a blocking function, such as
linknanomsg:sp_recv[3], it will be unblocked once _sp_term()_ is called and
ETERM error will be returned to the user. Similarly, any attempt to invoke
a socket function other than linknanomsg:sp_close[3] after _sp_term()_ was
called will result in ETERM error.


RETURN VALUE
------------
Returns zero in case of success. Returns negative value in case of error and
sets 'errno' to to one of the values defined below.


ERRORS
------
No errors are defined.
